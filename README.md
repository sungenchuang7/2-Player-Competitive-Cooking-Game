# Programming-for-Business-Computing-Final-Project

This is a 2-player cooking game written using Python for the final project of the course Programming for Business Computing.
What inspired me to develop this game was Nintendo's famous cooking game, Overcooked. Since I liked cooking for leisure, I thought it would be interesting to write an immitation of it.
